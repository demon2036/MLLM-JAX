# Deprecated / Unused (for current TPU GRPO smoke-run)

This folder holds code that is **not needed** for the current validated workflow:

- **Task in scope**: `gsm8k + GRPO + Qwen2.5-7B` smoke training (3 steps) on TPU.
- Anything not required for that run (e.g. multimodal, Qwen3, unused kernels, etc.) can be moved here to keep the active tree minimal.

Notes:
- Files under `deprecated/` may be incomplete/stale and are **not** guaranteed to work.
- If you need to revive any deprecated module, move it back to the active tree and re-validate on TPU.
