# GRPO/GSM8K config: increase rollout batch_size to 32 (prompts per step, per process)
# and set `max_length_sample=1024` for timing experiments.
#
# Derived from: `plugins/training/configs/grpo_gsm8k_default.yaml`
# Notes:
# - For TPU runs, keep secrets (WANDB_API_KEY) in `/root/.env` (not committed).
# - This config is meant for throughput / scaling experiments.
