# GRPO/GSM8K config (Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct): global_prompt_batch_size=128 prompts per training step (global)
#
# In this repo:
# - `rollout.global_prompt_batch_size` is prompts per training step (global, across all processes)
# - `rollout.batch_size` is sequences per training step (global, across all processes)
# - `rollout.prompt_batch_size` is prompts per rollout pass (per process)
# - `rollout.num_pre_q` is samples per prompt (GRPO group size, K)
# - `local_batch` (sequences per step, per process) = rollout.prompt_batch_size * rollout.num_pre_q * rollout_passes
#
# This config sets:
# - rollout.global_prompt_batch_size=128, rollout.num_pre_q=8 -> global sequences/step = 1024
# - train.micro_batch_size=32 -> runner infers grad_accum_steps at runtime
#
# Intended use: v6e-16 multi-host training (100 steps) with W&B logging.
