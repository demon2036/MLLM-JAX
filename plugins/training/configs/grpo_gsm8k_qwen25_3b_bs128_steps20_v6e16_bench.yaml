# GRPO/GSM8K benchmark config (Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct)
#
# Purpose: short, timing-focused run for v6e-16 with W&B online.
#
# Key setting:
# - `mesh_shape: auto` resolves to full-device FSDP (topology-aware):
#   dp=1, fsdp=device_count, tp=1 (equivalent to `mesh_shape: 1,-1,1`).
#   This maximizes parameter sharding and was measured to be faster for this
#   rollout-heavy (decode-dominated) GRPO benchmark on `v6e-16`.
