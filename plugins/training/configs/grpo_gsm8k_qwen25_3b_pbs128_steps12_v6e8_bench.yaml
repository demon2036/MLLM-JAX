# GRPO/GSM8K benchmark config (Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct)
#
# Purpose: timing-focused run with *prompt* batch size 128 on v6e-8.
#
# Naming note:
# - `pbs128` means `rollout.batch_size: 128` global PROMPTS per step.
# - With `rollout.n: 8`, this is 1024 sequences/step, so we split rollout into passes.
#
# Notes:
# - `mesh_shape: auto` keeps v6e-8 behavior equivalent to `1,-1,1`, but also
#   avoids the v6e-16 cross-host-FSDP pitfall if this config is reused there.
# - Eval is disabled to avoid timing spikes.
