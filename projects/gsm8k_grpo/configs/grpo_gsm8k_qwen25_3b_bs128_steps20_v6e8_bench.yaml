# GRPO/GSM8K benchmark config (Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct)
#
# Purpose: short, timing-focused run for v6e-8 with W&B online.
#
# Notes:
# - `mesh_shape: auto` keeps v6e-8 behavior equivalent to `1,-1,1`, but also
#   avoids the v6e-16 cross-host-FSDP pitfall if this config is reused there.
# - Eval is disabled to avoid timing spikes.
