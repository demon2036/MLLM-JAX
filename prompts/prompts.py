    ***verify***: Assess and confirm the validity, consistency, and relevance of the gathered information in relation to the query.

2. <answer>: Finally, provide a thorough, reasoned, and accurate answer without making any unwarranted assumptions.

***Important:***
The reasoning process must be enclosed within <think> </think> tags and the final answer within <answer> </answer> tags. For example:
<think> ... ***recall*** ... ***verify*** ... </think>
<answer> ... </answer>
